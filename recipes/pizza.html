    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Quick and easy for those summer cookouts. I often make as an appetizer
      while the ribs are cooking. Use whatever toppings you normally like on
      regular pizza, but the barbeque chicken is always a crowd pleaser! The
      dough never makes a perfect rectangle, but we have fun guessing what it
      looks like ('That looks like America!'). For the chicken, I use the
      grilled chicken pre-cooked at the store.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup chopped cooked chicken</li>
      <li>Â½ cup barbeque sauce, divided</li>
      <li>1 (13.8 ounce) package refrigerated pizza dough</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese</li>
      <li>1 cup diced tomatoes, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
      <li>
        Mix chicken and 2 tablespoons barbeque sauce together in a bowl until
        evenly coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll dough onto a work surface and cut in half to form 2 rectangles.
        Brush the top of each rectangle with olive oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place dough, oil-side down, onto the grill; cook until bottom of dough
        is browned and top is bubbling up, about 5 minutes. Brush the tops of
        each dough with oil and flip.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread the remaining barbeque sauce over each crust; top with chicken,
        Colby-Monterey Jack cheese, and tomatoes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Close the lid of the grill and cook pizza until cheese is melted, 2 to 3
        minutes. Remove pizza from grill and cool before slicing, 2 to 3
        minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
