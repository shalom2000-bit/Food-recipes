    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Delicious and surprisingly simple to make. Sushi is expensive to buy at
      the supermarket, so making your own will save you tons of money. My
      husband is a sushi freak! I make this for him all the time.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ cup Japanese sushi-style rice</li>
      <li>¾ cup water</li>
      <li>1⅓ tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
      <li>1⅓ tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>2¼ teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>8 frozen tempura shrimp</li>
      <li>2 sheets nori (dry seaweed)</li>
      <li>2 sticks imitation crabmeat, cut into 1/4-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1 cucumber - peeled, seeded, and cut into 1/4-inch strips</li>
      <li>1 avocado, sliced</li>
      <li>
        10 ounces frozen unagi kabayaki (grilled eel), thawed and sliced into
        2-inch strips
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Rinse rice in a strainer until water runs clear.</li>
      <li>
        Combine rice and water in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to
        low, cover, and cook until rice is tender and water is absorbed, about
        20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small saucepan over low heat;
        stir until sugar is dissolved, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour over rice; stir
        until rice cools and looks dry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet
        with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>Arrange shrimp tempura on the baking sheet.</li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until golden and crispy, about 6 minutes per
        side. Cut tails off 4 of the tempura shrimp.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover a bamboo sushi rolling mat with plastic wrap. Lay 1 sheet of nori,
        shiny-side down, on the plastic wrap. Spread 1 cup rice on top using
        moistened fingers, leaving a 1/3-inch border. Flip nori so rice is
        facing the mat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrange imitation crabmeat and cucumber along the bottom edge of the
        nori sheet. Place 2 tail-off shrimp in the center of the nori sheet.
        Place 2 tail-on shrimp on the end so that the tails extend over the
        sides of the sheet. Lift the edge of the mat and roll up nori into a
        tight log around filling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer sushi roll to a serving plate. Layer avocado and unagi slices
        on top to cover the top and sides of the roll. Slice roll into 8 pieces
        using a moistened knife. Repeat with remaining nori, rice, crabmeat,
        cucumber, avocado, and unagi to make a second roll.
      </li>
    </ol>
